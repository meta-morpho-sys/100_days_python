# The U.S. States Game

## Rules of the Game
On a blank map of the USA, fill is as many of the 50 States as you can remember.
You will be prompted each time you enter correctly a State name for another State until all 50 States are printed out on the map.


## Tasks for dev
1. Use the `50_states.csv` to check Users answer against it to see if it matches any of them.
2. User input should be non case-sensitive
3. When the User types in a State that is within the `50_states.csv` then the State name should appear on the map at the location where it exists
4. If a User guess is wrong then nothing happens and the User is again prompted for another guess.
5. Show how many States (out of 50) have been guessed correctly. (Guess Tracker)
6. Update the guesses tracker each time the State is guessed correctly.
